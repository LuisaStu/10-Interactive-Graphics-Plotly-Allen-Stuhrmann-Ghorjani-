## Introduction

- **What is Plotly?**
  - Think of it as your personal graph genie—just rub the lamp (or type a few lines of code), and you will have magical graphs on your screen. Plotly is a graphing library that transforms mundane data into visual stories you can interact with.
  
- **Why use Plotly?**
  - Simple syntax: If you can order coffee at a café, you can create graphs with Plotly.
  - Integration with R: Plays nicely with our favorite programming language
  - Versatility: From basic bar charts to 3D plots, Plotly supports a wide variety of graph types.

## What is Plotly Good For?

- **Interactive Visualizations:**  With Plotly, you can interact with your data like never before much better than with normal plots or visualization.

- **Dashboards:** Want to impress your colleagues (or professor)? Plotly makes it easy to create dashboards that can make even the most mundane data look like you actually spent alot of time on it.

- **Presentation:** You wont need anymore basic ggplots and static graphs. Using Plotly you can engage your audience while giving reports and presentations such as this! It also fits seamlessly into R Markdown allowing you to access your data directly.

## How to Use Plotly in R (Basic Example- Scatter Plot)

1. **Install the Package**: `install.packages('plotly')`
2. **Basic Example**: Using the 'Teams' dataset from the Lahman package, lets create a scatter plot to observe the numeric variables of attendance and homeruns to see if there is a trend.
3. **Toggle Interactive Plot**: Save plot as PNG, Zoom in/out, Pan, Box, Lasso, Autoscale and Reset.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#load libraries
library(Lahman)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(htmltools)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

# Load the Teams dataset
data("Teams")

Teams <- Teams %>%
  rename(`Team Name` = name) %>%
  filter(yearID > 2000)
 
```

--

.pull-left[
```{r}
p <- plot_ly(data = Teams,
             x = ~attendance,
             y = ~HR, 
             type = 'scatter', 
             mode = 'markers') 
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=F, fig.width = 6.25, fig.height = 4}
p
```
]

<style>
.custom-slide .remark-code, .custom-slide .remark-inline-code {
    font-size: 14px;
}
</style>

## Adjusting our Scatterplot

1. **Hovertext**: Allows us to modify what we see when hovering over observations, such as the Year, Team, and League.
2. **Ggplot Similarities**: We can also add arguments such as axis, shapes, and other characteristics.
- Extra help with [`scatter`](https://plotly.com/r/line-and-scatter/) plots.

.pull-left[
```{r}
p <- Teams %>%
  filter(attendance != 0) %>%  
  plot_ly(
    x = ~attendance,  
    y = ~HR,    
    type = 'scatter',
    mode = 'markers',
    text = ~paste('Team: ', `Team Name`, '<br>Year: ', yearID, '<br>League: ', lgID),  # Custom hover text
    hoverinfo = 'text', 
    marker = list(
      symbol = 'triangle-up', 
      color = ifelse(Teams$lgID == 'NL', 'red', 'blue')  # Color based on League ID
    )
  ) %>%
  layout(
    xaxis = list(tickangle = 45)  # Rotate the x-axis labels to 45 degrees
  )
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=F, fig.width = 6.25, fig.height = 4}
p
```
]

## Histograms with Plotly

- Lets create histograms to check our distribution (like a good Data Scientist).
- We'll look at the distribution of Home Runs.
- Extra help with [`histogram`](https://plotly.com/r/histograms/) plots!

--
  .pull-left[
```{r}
p <- plot_ly(
  data = Teams,
  x = ~HR,  
  type = 'histogram',
  nbinsx = 50,  
  marker = list(color = 'lightblue')
) %>%
  layout(
    title = 'Distribution of Home Runs (HR)',
    xaxis = list(title = 'Home Runs'),
    yaxis = list(title = 'Frequency')
  )
```
]

  .pull-right[
```{r, echo=F, fig.width = 6.25, fig.height = 4}
p
```
]

## Bar Charts with Plotly

- In this example, we'll use a stacked bar chart to look at the best team in the league (Chicago Cubs), by checking their number of winning and losing seasons. 
- Extra help with [`bar`](https://plotly.com/r/bar-charts/) plots. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

team_wins_losses <- Teams %>%
  filter(yearID >= 2000, `Team Name` == "Chicago Cubs") %>%
  group_by(yearID, `Team Name`) %>%
  summarize(total_wins = sum(W), total_losses = sum(L), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(total_wins, total_losses), 
               names_to = "result", 
               values_to = "count")  
```

--
  .pull-left[
```{r}
plot_display <- plot_ly(
  data = team_wins_losses,
  x = ~yearID,  # Year
  y = ~count,   # Number of Wins or Losses
  color = ~result,  # Color based on Wins or Losses
  colors = c("total_wins" = "darkgreen", "total_losses" = "red"),  
  type = 'bar',
  text = ~paste(result, ': ', count),  
  hoverinfo = 'text' 
) %>%
  layout(
    title = 'Total Wins and Losses by Cubs per Year ',
    xaxis = list(title = 'Year'),
    yaxis = list(title = 'Count'),
    barmode = 'stack' 
  )
```
]

  .pull-right[
```{r, echo=F, fig.width = 6.25, fig.height = 4}
plot_display
```
]

## GGPLOT

1. **Step 1**: Create or find a ggplot. In this case we'll use the mtcars data from baseR.
2. **Step 2**: Use ggplotly function to transform.
- Extra help with [`ggplotly`](https://plotly.com/ggplot2/) plots.
--
--
  .pull-left[
```{r}
  data("mtcars")
  p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = factor(cyl)), size = 3) +
    labs(
      title = "Horsepower vs. Miles per Gallon (mpg)",
      x = "Miles per Gallon (mpg)",
      y = "Horsepower (hp)",
      color = "Cylinders"
    ) +
    theme_minimal()
interactive_plot <- ggplotly(p)
```
]

  .pull-right[
```{r, echo=F, fig.width = 6.25, fig.height = 4}
interactive_plot
```
]
